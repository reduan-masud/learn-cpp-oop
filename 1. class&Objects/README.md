# C++ Classes / Objects
c++ is an object-oriented programming language.

Everything in c++ is associate with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an *object*. The Car has *attributes*, such as weight and color, and *methods*, such as drive and break.

Attributes and methods are basically *variables* and *functions* that belongs to the class. These are often reffered to as "class members".

A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program tand it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
