# Access Specifiers
By now, you are quite familiar with the *public* keyword that appears in all of out class examples:

The *public* keyword is an **access specifier**. Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are *public* - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code

`
class MyClass{
public:
	// class members goes here
};
`
